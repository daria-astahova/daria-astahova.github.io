    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Vidma Les is an atmospheric multiplayer exploration game set in a mystical forest where players assume the role of a newly appointed forest ranger. The game emphasizes cooperative exploration, environmental storytelling, and puzzle-solving as players work together to uncover the secrets of the enchanted woods while avoiding dangers that lurk within. Loosly based off of many slavic myths and folktales, you will encounter various mythical creatures and spirits as you take care of the forest. How you treat the forest is how it will treat you.

    <h2>Process & Development</h2>
   
      <h4>May 2025:</h4>
      <p>
During the semester we were told to create assets for this game and use as many of our own created assets as possible. With limited experience in asset creation, I focused on creating simple yet effective models that fit the game's aesthetic. I ended up creating a detailed firepit for camping, a low poly tent, a bulletin board, Wooden bench, Statue, Wooden fence, and a low poly deer. I do hope to create more detailed and aesthetic models in the future.

        After a few set backs continued working on Vidma Les within class. Focus on starting with small details to the game that are essential to a introduction style level. Adding commponents with making sure the player has a "guide" that allows them to accept quests and learn more about the world. Continued working on first game mechanic with was to collect wood from the trees around camp and bring them to the fireplace to burn. Opening up the next quest for the player to meet the deer.

      <h4>December 2024:</h4>
        Began development on Vidma Les as a solo project, focusing on core gameplay mechanics and environmental design. Before even working on the game itself, I spent a lot of time researching slavic myths and folktales to get inspiration for the game's setting and atmosphere. I also haven't yet started creating assets for this game yet but rather get a better understanding of how I want the game to play and feel.

    <p>
      The final game successfully supports multiplayer sessions while maintaining
      the social energy of the original board game. This project strengthened my

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
    I learned a lot about game development and asset creation throughout the process of working on Vidma Les. I improved my skills in Unity and C#, gaining a deeper understanding of game mechanics and systems. Additionally, I enhanced my 3D modeling skills using Blender, learning how to create assets that fit within a specific aesthetic and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the game. This project also taught me the importance of environmental storytelling and how to design levels that encourage exploration and engagement. Overall, working on Vidma Les has been a valuable experience that has helped me grow as a game developer.
