    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s Get Famous is a digital adaptation of a physical board game focused on
      social interaction, strategy, and player-driven chaos. The project explores
      how traditional board game mechanics can translate into a multiplayer
      digital environment while preserving personality and spontaneity.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Translating a highly social, fast-paced board game into a digital format
        without losing player interaction or energy.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        A turn-based system supported by interactive card mechanics and
        multiplayer logic that encourages sabotage, strategy, and replayability.

    <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>Designed core game mechanics and ruleset</li>
      <li>Implemented gameplay systems in Unity</li>
      <li>Developed multiplayer turn logic</li>

    <h2>Process & Development</h2>
    <p>
      Development began with paper prototypes and playtesting before moving into
      Unity. The card and tile systems were iterated multiple times based on user
      feedback to improve pacing and balance.

    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Synchronizing player actions in a multiplayer environment required careful
      structuring of the game loop. This was solved by clearly separating player
      input, resolution, and feedback states.

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The final game successfully supports multiplayer sessions while maintaining
      the social energy of the original board game. This project strengthened my
      understanding of multiplayer systems and collaborative design.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
      This project reinforced the importance of iteration, playtesting, and clear
      system design while expanding my technical skills in Unity and multiplayer
      logic.
