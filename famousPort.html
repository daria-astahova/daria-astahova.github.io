                    <p  >“Let's Get Famous: The Video Game" takes the beloved board game
                        created by Tony Rice and brings it into the digital realm, thanks to the remastering efforts of
                        Daria Brown. <br>
                    <p  > I'm currently developing a game based on a board game created by a
                        friend. Using Unity, the
                        game will feature a pixelated art style reminiscent of classic video games and will provide
                        multiplayer functionality for players to enjoy and connect with one another.<br>
                        Set within the competitive landscape of celebrity culture, players embark on a journey to
                        stardom
                    <p  > while navigating through various scenes and challenges on the game
                        board. There are fourteen
                        diverse characters to choose from, each boasting a unique personality and aspirations that
                        intensify the race to claim the spotlight and achieve A-list celebrity status.<br>
                    <p  >The game currently includes a card function that randomizes cards for
                        three players, each
                        containing different challenges. For example, the "Strength Card" initiates a mini-game where
                        players must perform random exercises. When one player fails, another player is prompted to
                        push a button and receive a card. This continues until a winner is determined.

This tacks are not changeable in the game and allow each player to play depending of strengths. Examples: Daria would have more tacks in Luck, however, lack in wealth or talent. While Raeann could have more tacks in Wealth and Talent, but lack tacks within Networking or Luck. <i>(subject to change)</i> </p>

                            <p><strong>WEEK ONE: CONCEPTUALIZATION AND PLANNING STAGE 2/26/2024 - 3/3/2024:</strong></p>
                            <p  >Over the upcoming four weeks, our project will center on Conceptualization and Planning. This phase involves a thorough examination of the game concept, gathering important design information, and defining core mechanics, features, and gameplay elements. We'll produce a comprehensive design document detailing characters, skills, cards, spaces, and mechanics. As we approach the fourth week, we'll focus on strategizing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design and begin outlining plans for the next project stage. Given our small development team, it's important to note that the projected timeline may be subject to extensions on deadlines and stages.</p>
