            <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
            <strong>Topic Selection:</strong>

            <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> I chose to analyze our friend group photos out of curiosity, exploring who
                typically stands beside each other and what it reveals about our friendships. The topic intrigued me,
                sparking a desire to delve into the dynamics within our group. In this project, I'll present everyone's
                data on their most frequent standing partners, explore zodiac compatibility, and track how dynamics
                evolve over a 7-month period. It's a journey into our friendships, revealing patterns and changes that
                add depth to our shared experiences.
                <strong>Data Collection:</strong>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> I collected data for this narrative by thoroughly examining 100 group photos.
                Using a spreadsheet, I recorded who stood next to whom in each photo. To simplify the task, I
                established criteriaâ€”each photo had to include a minimum of four individuals, with at least three people
                forming a group. This approach lightened the workload while revealing interesting patterns in our
                interactions. It provided a structured method for delving into the social dynamics within each snapshot,
                contributing to a comprehensive analysis.<br>

                <h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>307</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Based on the data, a key conclusion is the individual Daria and Raeann have the highest
                            count of standing next to each other during photos with 29 occurrences. Tony and Raeann are
                            a close second with 27 occurrences. The data alone could tell you that these individuals
                            spend a lot of time together, and then it is understood when you find the relationship
                            between the three individuals is that they are roommates. Daria and Tony only occur 9 times
                            next to each other, which indicates that Raeann could possibly have a possibility of being
                            in the middle of Daria and Tony.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Most Frequent</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's clear that Daria plays a prominent role in the top three standing positions for 11 out
                            of the 14 individuals, underscoring her pivotal influence on the social dynamics observed.
                            This holds particular significance given Daria's role as the project developer, highlighting
                            her central involvement in shaping and analyzing the dataset. Her consistent presence in key
                            standing positions reinforces her impact on the overall group dynamics captured in the
                            photos. Daria plays a key role in connecting different members. She has ties to Tony and
                            Bailey from freshman year, was Raeann's sophomore year roommate, introduced Paige to the
                            group, and shares a history growing up with Alex. These varied connections highlight Daria's
                            central role in bringing together different aspects of the group's social dynamics.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Least Frequent:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's interesting to note that the least frequent standing partners are Alex and Bailey, who
                            only stand next to each other in 3 photos. This is surprising given that they are both
                            members of the same sorority and have known each other since freshman year. This data
                            suggests that they may not be as close as one would expect, and that their relationship may
                            not be as strong as it appears on the surface. This is an interesting finding that could
                            prompt further exploration into the dynamics of their relationship.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <li>Photo Anlysis</li>
                    <ul>Certainly, the dispersed positions in the photos offer evidence of social dynamics and
                        individual comfort levels. The inclination to stand closer to someone in photos, as noted in
                        the analysis, often indicates a sense of comfort or a desire to be with that person. This
                        connection between physical proximity in photos and real-life comfort implies that the
                        group's spatial dynamics reflect deeper social connections and individual preferences within
                        the friend group. There exists a fascinating study that explains the intricacies of human
                        interaction, examining the placement, position, and tilt of heads and body language within
                        group settings. This research talks about the math anf logic about relationships within a
                        space. Although its complexity may currently exceed my current capacity for exploration, a
                        particularly captivating aspect of this research highlights - a tendency among men to
                        position themselves on the outer edges of group photos. I wonders whether you will start
                        observing and contemplating this phenomenon in your future group photos.</ul>
                    <li>Evidence:</li>
                    <ul>
                        Analyzing each person's top three standing positions potentially offers valuable insights into
                        the relationships within the friend group. By examining these positions and considering the
                        contextâ€”whether it's the present or when the photos were takenâ€”it becomes a key indicator of
                        social dynamics and connections. The unexpected presence of Raeann and Rami in each other's top
                        three, despite lacking a pre-existing relationship, suggests a connection formed since their
                        initial meeting. This prompts further exploration into how their bond evolved within the
                        dynamics of the friend group. The revelation that Raeann and Rami later became girlfriends adds
                        a fascinating layer, emphasizing the dynamic nature of friendships and how subtle indicators in
                        group photos can evolve into meaningful connections over time.
