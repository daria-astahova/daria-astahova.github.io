            <h3>Lets Get Famous</h3>
            <p>Spring 2024 - Present</p>
            <p>
                I'm currently in the process of developing a game based on my friend's board game, "Get Famous," using Unity. The game will feature a pixelated art style reminiscent of classic video games, aiming to provide multiplayer functionality for players to enjoy and connect with one another.</p>
                <p>So far, the game includes a card function that randomizes cards for three players, each containing different challenges. One notable card is the "Strength Card," which initiates a mini-game where players must perform random exercises. The first player to fail prompts another player to push a button, continuing until a winner is determined.</p>
                <p>Incorporating principles from my class GIMM 290: Game Design Theory, the game is designed with multiple objectives to heighten interactivity and engagement. Players can strive to beat the game, sabotage others, socialize and drink, or amass as many points as possible. While the primary aim remains reaching the end of the board game, additional objectives cater to individual preferences, such as aiming to be the most intoxicated or the most sober player in the group.</p>
                <p>Set within the competitive landscape of celebrity culture, players embark on a journey to stardom, navigating through various scenes and challenges on the game board. With a diverse ensemble cast of 14 characters to choose from, including Daria, Raeann, Tony, Paige, Sami, Rami, Tegan, Alex, Jace, Logan, Adam, Sophie, Bailey, and Aileen, each character boasts unique personalities and aspirations, intensifying the race to claim the spotlight and achieve A-list celebrity status.</p>

            <h3>Group Photos Data - MOBILE NARRATIVE GAME</h3>
            <p>Fall 2023</p>
            <p>
                This project, crafted during my time in GIMM 260, entailed the creation of a website that meticulously incorporated 100 photos from my friend group. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I honed my technical skills in web development throughout the design process. However, beyond technical proficiency, this endeavor provided deeper insights into the dynamics within my friend group, enabling me to discern and predict certain trends.

            <h3>Individual Game</h3>
            <p>Fall 2021</p>
            <p>
                My initial start within the GIMM program and into Unity marked the inception of my journey in game developmentâ€”  the evolution of my skills. This project served as a showcase of my progress, highlighting the fundamental concepts of Unity development that I had just begun to grasp. While the experience was filled with enjoyment, it was also characterized by a sense of uncertainty, as I navigated through unfamiliar territory with limited understanding. Looking back, it's evident that I had much to learn, but the experience laid the groundwork for my growth and development in the field of game design.</p>

            <h3>Interactive comic book</h3>
            <p>Spring 2022</p>
            <p>
               A unity project designed with 2 other GIMM majors. Our collaborative endeavor resulted in the creation of an innovative interactive comic book, blending the realms of augmented reality (AR) and traditional storytelling. By scanning specific cards, users were transported into captivating animated scenes that brought the narrative to life. Following each animation, players engaged in mini-games to progress through the story. This project, developed in collaboration with two other individuals, provided me with invaluable insights into AR technology and image scanning techniques. It was a journey of learning and experimentation, culminating in the successful implementation of AR elements into an iPhone environment.</p>

            <h3>Ball to the Wall</h3>
            <p>Spring 2024</p>
            <p>This is a web-based game inspired by the classic Tic Tac Toe. Developed collaboratively with two other GIMM majors, we brainstormed and designed the game mechanics during a class session, using a whiteboard to sketch out our ideas. Subsequently, I took the initiative to translate our concept into a playable online version, allowing users to enjoy the game at their convenience. Although the project is still a work in progress, there are several bugs that require attention and refinement.</p>

            <h3>Scene From Silver Linings Playbook - Directed by Doug Campbell</h3>
            <p>Spring 2024</p>
            <p> On March 10, 2024, I participated in a project within FILM 494: Workshop for - Acting and Directing for the Camera. As a member of the production team, we collaborated on crafting five scenes from various films under the direction of <a href="https://www.entlab.la/doug-campbell">Doug Campbell</a>. This immersive experience not only enhanced my comfort level within a collaborative work environment but also provided valuable insights into the process of conceptualizing, planning, and executing a film production.</p>
            <p>
                This experience will undoubtedly serve as a solid foundation for my future endeavors in game design and animation. The skills and insights gained from working on this film project, including collaboration, creative problem-solving, and attention to detail, will undoubtedly translate seamlessly into my future productions in the realms of game design and animation. Furthermore, my efforts as an actor and assistant director has provided me with a better understanding of the intricacies of working with actors. This experience has equipped me with valuable insights on how to effectively communicate with actors, understand their needs, and collaborate harmoniously to bring creative visions to life.</p>
            <p> One of the scenes we produced served as my personal project, wherein I had the opportunity to act alongside my co-star, Jacob Cabral. This particular scene also showcased my proficiency in video editing using Premiere Pro. This hands-on experience allowed me to further develop my skills and gain practical knowledge in the realm of film production and editing.</p>
