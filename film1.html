                    <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">â€œLet's Get Famous: The Video Game" takes the beloved board game
                        created by Tony Rice and brings it into the digital realm, thanks to the remastering efforts of
                        Daria Brown. <br>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> I'm currently developing a game based on a board game created by a
                        friend. Using Unity, the
                        game will feature a pixelated art style reminiscent of classic video games and will provide
                        multiplayer functionality for players to enjoy and connect with one another.<br>
                        Set within the competitive landscape of celebrity culture, players embark on a journey to
                        stardom
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> while navigating through various scenes and challenges on the game
                        board. There are fourteen
                        diverse characters to choose from, each boasting a unique personality and aspirations that
                        intensify the race to claim the spotlight and achieve A-list celebrity status.<br>
                    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The game currently includes a card function that randomizes cards for
                        three players, each
                        containing different challenges. For example, the "Strength Card" initiates a mini-game where
                        players must perform random exercises. When one player fails, another player is prompted to
                        push a button and receive a card. This continues until a winner is determined.

                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> March 9th 2024 - March 10th 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In March 2024, I participated in a project within FILM 494: Workshop
                    for - Acting and Directing for the Camera. As a member of the production team, we collaborated on
                    crafting five scenes from various films under the direction of <a
                        href="https://www.entlab.la/doug-campbell">Doug Campbell. </a> This immersive experience not
                    only enhanced my comfort level within a collaborative work environment but also provided valuable
                    insights into the process of conceptualizing, planning, and executing a film production. </p>
                <p> This experience will undoubtedly enhance my future endeavors in game design and animation. The
                    skills and insights gained from working on this film project, including collaboration, creative
                    problem-solving, and attention to detail, will translate seamlessly into my future productions in
                    the realms of game design and animation. Furthermore, my efforts as an actor and assistant director
                    provided a better understanding of the intricacies of working with actors, including effectively
                    communicating with actors, understanding their needs, and collaborating harmoniously to bring
                    creative visions to life.</p>
                <p> One of the scenes served as my personal project and I had the opportunity to act alongside my
                    co-star, Jacob Cabral. This particular scene showcased my proficiency in video editing using
                    Premiere Pro, and the hands-on experience allowed me to further develop my skills and gain practical
                    knowledge in the realm of film production and editing. </p>
