                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> March 9th 2024 - March 10th 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In March 2024, I participated in a project within FILM 494: Workshop
                    for - Acting and Directing for the Camera. As a member of the production team, we collaborated on
                    crafting five scenes from various films under the direction of <a
                        href="https://www.entlab.la/doug-campbell">Doug Campbell. </a> This immersive experience not
                    only enhanced my comfort level within a collaborative work environment but also provided valuable
                    insights into the process of conceptualizing, planning, and executing a film production. </p>
                <p> This experience will undoubtedly enhance my future endeavors in game design and animation. The
                    skills and insights gained from working on this film project, including collaboration, creative
                    problem-solving, and attention to detail, will translate seamlessly into my future productions in
                    the realms of game design and animation. Furthermore, my efforts as an actor and assistant director
                    provided a better understanding of the intricacies of working with actors, including effectively
                    communicating with actors, understanding their needs, and collaborating harmoniously to bring
                    creative visions to life.</p>
                <p> One of the scenes served as my personal project and I had the opportunity to act alongside my
                    co-star, Jacob Cabral. This particular scene showcased my proficiency in video editing using
                    Premiere Pro, and the hands-on experience allowed me to further develop my skills and gain practical
                    knowledge in the realm of film production and editing. </p>
