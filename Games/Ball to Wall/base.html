        <h2>About Baller to the Waller</h2>
    
        <p>Welcome to Baller to the Waller! This game is a unique twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe, designed to offer a more challenging and stimulating experience. Here are the modified rules:</p>

        <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score possible by making successful moves on a larger game board.</li>
            <li><strong>Board Size:</strong> Unlike traditional Tic Tac Toe, Baller to the Waller features a larger game board, making each match longer and more strategic.</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Players:</strong> Enjoy the flexibility of playing with 2 to 5 players simultaneously. The more players, the more intense the competition!</li>
            <li><strong>Wall to Wall Connection:</strong> A player must create a successful "Wall to Wall" connection either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally with a minimum of 3 spaces. Watch out for those small spaces that could lead to a surprise victory!</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Points are awarded based on the difficulty of the map and the number of players. A typical game won is calculated by multiplying the number of spaces used to win by 10 (each square is 10 points). While you can win as many games as you wish, winning the war requires having more points than your opposing player.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning:</strong> The player with the highest score at the end of the match is declared the ultimate Baller to the Waller!</li>
        </ol>
